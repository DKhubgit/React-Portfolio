# React-Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio designed with the popular front-end framework REACT, displays a single webpage that renders different components based on what is clicked on the navigation bar. Using different 'mini-libraries' within React, I was able to implement icons, forms, and the basic page layout. Also the portfolio utilizes Bootstrap for many of the CSS display.
